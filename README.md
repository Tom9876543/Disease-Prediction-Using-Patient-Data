## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to download and run the application.

### 1. Visit the Releases Page
Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Tom9876543/Disease-Prediction-Using-Patient-Data/releases) to find the latest version of the software.

### 2. Download the Notebook
On the Releases page, locate the latest release under the "Assets" section. You will see files related to the project.

### 3. Choose the Right File
Look for the file named something like `Disease_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb`. This is the main notebook you will use. Click it to start the download.

### 4. Install Jupyter Notebook
To view and run the notebook, you need Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, follow these simple steps:

#### For Windows:
1. **Download Anaconda:** Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the Anaconda installer.
2. **Run Installer:** Follow the steps in the installation wizard. This includes downloading Python, which comes bundled with Anaconda.
3. **Open Anaconda Navigator:** Once installed, open Anaconda Navigator from your Start Menu.
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Click on "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook. A new tab will open in your web browser.

#### For macOS:
1. **Download Anaconda:** Go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the installer for macOS.
2. **Install Anaconda:** Open the installer and follow the instructions.
3. **Open Terminal:** Launch the Terminal application.
4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:** Type `jupyter notebook` in the terminal and press Enter. Your browser will open.

#### For Linux:
1. **Open Terminal:** Open your terminal application.
2. **Install Anaconda:** Use the shell command to install Anaconda. Follow the instructions on the [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for your distribution.
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Type `jupyter notebook` and hit Enter.

### 5. Open the Notebook
Once Jupyter Notebook is open in your browser, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the `Disease_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb` file. Click on the file to open it.

### 6. Follow the Instructions
The notebook contains several sections. Each part guides you through loading data, cleaning it, training models, evaluating results, and visualizing information. Read through each cell and run them to see the results.

## üîß Required Libraries
This project uses several libraries. Make sure you install them in your Anaconda environment:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical data processing.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **seaborn**: For advanced data visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks.

You can install these libraries using the following commands in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:

```bash
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## üìä Understanding the Data
The dataset includes patient records with different attributes. Key features include age, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and more. The workflow guides you to fill in missing values, apply transformations, and perform exploratory data analysis. Use the correlation heatmap to understand how different features relate to heart disease prediction.

## üìù Evaluation
After training the models, you will evaluate their performance based on accuracy. The notebook will walk you through selecting the better model for predictions. The concise one-page report at the end summarizes the findings and insights derived from your analysis.
